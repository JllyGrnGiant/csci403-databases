Project 6

My working directory for creating a database-backed application using an ORM to Morpheus'
specifications... Otherwise the clowns will kill me.

This application will model a zoo.

Entities:
Zoo
Habitat
Animal
Feed
User

Relationships:
Zoos have multiple Habitats. Each Habitat may only belong to one Zoo.
Habitats contain multiple Animals. Each Animal may only live in one Habitat.
Animals eat many types of Feed. Multiple Animals may eat the same type of Feed.
Users have multiple favorite Animals. Each Animal can be favorited by multiple Users.
