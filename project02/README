This is my directory for creating a wine database and a program to maintain it.  Original data is provided in wine.xlsx and wine.pd.txt

One of the problems with the data is in the price of wine.  One of the entries is 'free' which is of a different format than the numeric monetary values of the other entries.  There are probably other concerns as well that I don't see.
